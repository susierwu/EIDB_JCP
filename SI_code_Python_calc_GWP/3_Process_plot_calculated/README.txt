Due to the ecoinvent database licensing issue, following two excel sheets used in the "Process_calcedLCA.ipynb" file was not provided as they contains the final calculated GWP for selected LCI. 

	1. "eidb_cutoff_over3uniprod_LCAcalced_combProdName.xlsx" 
	2. "eidb_cutoff_over3uniprod_LCAcalced.xlsx"

To reproduce the plots illustrated in the "Process_calcedLCA.ipynb" file, you can go through "*.ipynb" files under the folders "1_RawEIDB_cleanup" and "2_Calculation" to save the excel sheets with GWP data.
